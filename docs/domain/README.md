# DouroBats Domain Design

## Overview

This document defines the core domain entities, relationships, and business rules for the DouroBats training attendance management system. This represents our **Minimum Viable Domain (MVD)** - a focused, production-ready foundation optimized for **scheduling and booking training sessions**.

## Domain Context

**DouroBats** is a multi-sport association managing training sessions for various sports (Volleyball, Futsal, Padel, etc.). The system enables:
- Athletes to view and confirm attendance for training sessions
- Committee members to manage schedules with proper access control
- Supporters to view information (read-only)

### Key Stakeholders

- **Athletes**: View schedule, confirm attendance, have skill levels (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- **Supporters**: View-only access to schedules and information
- **Committee Members**: Manage sessions, venues, calendar access, and athletes (with granular privileges)

---

## Core Domain Entities (10 Total)

### 1. User

The fundamental identity in the system representing any person.

**Attributes:**
- `id`: Unique identifier (UUID)
- `name`: Full name
- `email`: Email address (unique)
- `status`: Account status (Active, Inactive, Suspended)

**Responsibilities:**

- Activity tracking

---

### 2. UserRole

Defines what a user can do in the system through role assignment with granular Committee privileges.

**Attributes:**
- `id`: UUID
- `userId`: UUID - Reference to User
- `role`: Role - ATHLETE | SUPPORTER | COMMITTEE
- `privileges`: List<CommitteePrivilege> - Only for COMMITTEE role

**Committee Admin:**
- Committee member with all 5 privileges = **COMMITTEE_ADMIN**
- Only ADMIN can assign/revoke privileges to other Committee members

**Business Rules:**
1. User must have at least one role
2. ATHLETE and SUPPORTER are mutually exclusive
3. COMMITTEE can be combined with ATHLETE or SUPPORTER
4. Only COMMITTEE_ADMIN can assign privileges
5. System must have at least one COMMITTEE_ADMIN

**Valid Role Combinations:**
- ✅ Athlete only
- ✅ Supporter only
- ✅ Athlete + Committee
- ✅ Supporter + Committee
- ❌ Athlete + Supporter (mutually exclusive)

---

### 3. AthleteProfile

- Unlocked: Jan 1 - Feb 28 (by João, Jan 1)
- Can unlock: Mar 1 - Mar 31 (sequential, within 3 months)
- Cannot unlock: May 1 - May 31 (gap in March-April)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Committee unlocks February calendar at end of January
- Different sports can have different scheduling horizons
- Audit trail shows who unlocked which periods when

---

### 8. SessionTemplate

**Business Rules:**
1. Only Committee members with MANAGE_SESSIONS privilege can create/edit templates
2. Templates generate individual TrainingSession records (not live-linked)
3. Generated sessions can still be individually edited or cancelled
4. Multiple templates can exist for same day/sport (e.g., Tuesday has 2 Volleyball slots)

**MVP Importance:** This is CRITICAL for MVP - enables Committee to quickly populate weekly schedules.

**Example Templates (Volleyball):**
```
1. "Tuesday Advanced" - TUE 20:00-21:30, Pavilhão Municipal, ADVANCED
2. "Tuesday Intermediate" - TUE 21:30-23:00, Pavilhão Municipal, INTERMEDIATE
3. "Sunday All Levels" - SUN 17:00-18:30, Pavilhão Municipal, ALL_LEVELS
```

**Use Case:**
1. Committee unlocks February calendar
2. System offers "Generate from templates" for all active Volleyball templates
3. Creates individual TrainingSession records for each Tuesday, Sunday in February
4. Committee can then edit/cancel individual sessions as needed

4. Cannot exceed capacity (enforced by Attendance logic)
5. Target level is informational - athletes of any level can attend
6. Cannot create sessions in the past
7. Venue must support the session's sport (via sport tags)

**Example:**
```
Tuesday Volleyball - Advanced Session
- Date: Feb 6, 2024, 20:00-21:30
- Venue: Pavilhão Municipal
- Target Level: ADVANCED

## Entity Relationships

### Cardinality

```
User (1) ---- (1..N) UserRole
   User must have at least one role

User (1) ---- (0..N) AthleteProfile
   User with ATHLETE role can have profiles for multiple sports

Sport (1) ---- (0..N) AthleteProfile
   Sport can have many athlete profiles at different levels

AthleteProfile (1) ---- (0..N) AthleteProfileHistory
   Profile can have many level change records

Sport (1) ---- (0..N) Venue
   Sport can be tagged to many Venues (via sportTags)

```

### Many-to-Many Relationships

**TrainingSession ↔ User** is managed through the **Attendance** entity:
- Many Athletes can attend many Training Sessions
- The Attendance entity adds metadata (status, timestamps, notes)

**Venue ↔ Sport** is managed through sport tags:
- Many Sports can use many Venues
- Venues have a `sportTags` list containing Sport IDs
- Enables sport-based filtering when creating sessions

---

## Business Rules

### Authorization Rules

#### 1. Supporter Restriction Rule
**Rule:** Supporters cannot confirm attendance for training sessions.

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
fun confirmAttendance(userId: UUID, sessionId: UUID) {
    val roles = getUserRoles(userId)

    if (!roles.contains(Role.ATHLETE)) {
        throw UnauthorizedException("Only athletes can confirm attendance")
    }

    // Continue with confirmation logic
}
```

#### 2. Committee Privilege Rules
**Rule:** Committee members need specific privileges for different management tasks.

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
fun createSession(userId: UUID, sessionData: SessionData) {
    requireCommitteePrivilege(userId, CommitteePrivilege.MANAGE_SESSIONS)
    // Continue with session creation
}

fun unlockCalendar(userId: UUID, sportId: UUID, period: DateRange) {
    requireCommitteePrivilege(userId, CommitteePrivilege.MANAGE_CALENDAR)
    // Continue with calendar unlocking
}

fun updateAthleteLevel(userId: UUID, athleteId: UUID, newLevel: AthleteLevel) {
    requireCommitteePrivilege(userId, CommitteePrivilege.MANAGE_ATHLETES)
    // Continue with level update
}

fun createVenue(userId: UUID, venueData: VenueData) {
    requireCommitteePrivilege(userId, CommitteePrivilege.MANAGE_VENUES)
    // Continue with venue creation
}

fun requireCommitteePrivilege(userId: UUID, privilege: CommitteePrivilege) {
    val roles = getUserRoles(userId)
    val committeeRole = roles.find { it.role == Role.COMMITTEE }
        ?: throw UnauthorizedException("User is not a Committee member")

    if (!committeeRole.privileges.contains(privilege)) {
        throw UnauthorizedException("Missing privilege: $privilege")
    }
}
```

#### 3. Committee Admin Rules
**Rule:** Only Committee members with all privileges (COMMITTEE_ADMIN) can assign/revoke privileges.

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
fun assignPrivilege(adminId: UUID, targetUserId: UUID, privilege: CommitteePrivilege) {
    val adminRole = getUserRoles(adminId).find { it.role == Role.COMMITTEE }
        ?: throw UnauthorizedException("Admin is not a Committee member")

    val allPrivileges = CommitteePrivilege.values().toSet()
    if (adminRole.privileges != allPrivileges) {
        throw UnauthorizedException("Only COMMITTEE_ADMIN can assign privileges")
    }

    // Continue with privilege assignment
}
```

### Capacity Rules

#### 4. Session Capacity Rule
**Rule:** Cannot confirm attendance if session is at full capacity.

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
fun confirmAttendance(userId: UUID, sessionId: UUID) {
    val session = getSession(sessionId)
    val currentAttendance = getConfirmedCount(sessionId)

    if (currentAttendance >= session.capacity) {
        throw CapacityExceededException("Session is at full capacity")
    }

    // Continue with confirmation
}
```

#### 5. Venue Capacity Rule
**Rule:** Venue capacity is informational only - session capacity is enforced instead.

**Rationale:** Same venue might host different sessions with different requirements.

### Temporal Rules

#### 6. Past Session Rule
**Rule:** Cannot confirm attendance for sessions that have already occurred.

#### 7. Cancelled Session Rule
**Rule:** Cannot confirm attendance for cancelled sessions.

### Calendar Access Rules

#### 8. Locked Calendar Rule
**Rule:** Cannot create sessions for dates outside unlocked calendar periods.

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
fun createSession(userId: UUID, sessionData: SessionData) {
    requireCommitteePrivilege(userId, CommitteePrivilege.MANAGE_SESSIONS)

    val calendarAccess = getCalendarAccess(sessionData.sportId, sessionData.date)
    if (calendarAccess == null) {
        throw UnauthorizedException("Calendar is locked for this date")
    }

    // Continue with session creation
}
```

#### 9. Sequential Unlock Rule
**Rule:** Calendar unlocking must be sequential with no gaps.

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
fun unlockCalendar(userId: UUID, sportId: UUID, startDate: Date, endDate: Date) {
    requireCommitteePrivilege(userId, CommitteePrivilege.MANAGE_CALENDAR)

    val latestUnlock = getLatestCalendarAccess(sportId)
    if (latestUnlock != null && startDate > latestUnlock.endDate.plusDays(1)) {
        throw BusinessRuleException("Cannot skip dates - must unlock sequentially")
    }

    // Continue with unlocking
}
```

#### 10. Maximum Unlock Period Rule
**Rule:** Cannot unlock calendar more than 3 months ahead.

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
fun unlockCalendar(userId: UUID, sportId: UUID, startDate: Date, endDate: Date) {
    val today = Date.now()
    val maxDate = today.plusMonths(3)

    if (endDate > maxDate) {
        throw BusinessRuleException("Cannot unlock beyond 3 months ahead")
    }

    // Continue with unlocking
}
```

### Role Assignment Rules

#### 11. Minimum Role Rule
**Rule:** User must have at least one role.

#### 12. Mutual Exclusivity Rule
**Rule:** User cannot be both ATHLETE and SUPPORTER simultaneously.

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
fun assignRole(userId: UUID, newRole: Role) {
    val existingRoles = getUserRoles(userId).map { it.role }

    if (newRole == Role.ATHLETE && existingRoles.contains(Role.SUPPORTER)) {
        throw BusinessRuleException("Cannot be both ATHLETE and SUPPORTER")
    }

    if (newRole == Role.SUPPORTER && existingRoles.contains(Role.ATHLETE)) {
        throw BusinessRuleException("Cannot be both ATHLETE and SUPPORTER")
    }

    // Continue with role assignment
}
```

#### 13. Athlete Profile Rule
**Rule:** Only users with ATHLETE role can have an AthleteProfile.

#### 14. System Admin Rule
**Rule:** System must always have at least one COMMITTEE_ADMIN.

## Implementation Notes

### Repository Pattern

Each entity will have a corresponding repository interface:

```kotlin
interface UserRepository {
    suspend fun findById(id: UUID): User?
    suspend fun findByEmail(email: String): User?
    suspend fun save(user: User): User
}

interface UserRoleRepository {
    suspend fun findByUserId(userId: UUID): List<UserRole>
    suspend fun findByRole(role: Role): List<UserRole>
    suspend fun save(userRole: UserRole): UserRole
    suspend fun delete(id: UUID)
}

interface AthleteProfileRepository {
    suspend fun findByUserId(userId: UUID): List<AthleteProfile>
    suspend fun findByUserIdAndSportId(userId: UUID, sportId: UUID): AthleteProfile?
    suspend fun findBySportId(sportId: UUID): List<AthleteProfile>
    suspend fun findByLevel(sportId: UUID, level: AthleteLevel): List<AthleteProfile>
    suspend fun save(profile: AthleteProfile): AthleteProfile
}

interface AthleteProfileHistoryRepository {
    suspend fun findByProfileId(profileId: UUID): List<AthleteProfileHistory>
    suspend fun save(history: AthleteProfileHistory): AthleteProfileHistory
}

interface SportRepository {
    suspend fun findById(id: UUID): Sport?
    suspend fun findActive(): List<Sport>
    suspend fun save(sport: Sport): Sport
}

interface VenueRepository {
    suspend fun findById(id: UUID): Venue?
    suspend fun findBySport(sportId: UUID): List<Venue>
    suspend fun findActive(): List<Venue>
    suspend fun save(venue: Venue): Venue
}

interface CalendarAccessRepository {
    suspend fun findBySport(sportId: UUID): List<CalendarAccess>
    suspend fun findLatest(sportId: UUID): CalendarAccess?
    suspend fun isDateUnlocked(sportId: UUID, date: Date): Boolean
    suspend fun save(calendarAccess: CalendarAccess): CalendarAccess
}

interface SessionTemplateRepository {
    suspend fun findById(id: UUID): SessionTemplate?
    suspend fun findBySport(sportId: UUID): List<SessionTemplate>
    suspend fun findActive(sportId: UUID): List<SessionTemplate>

```

### Use Case Pattern

Business logic will be encapsulated in Use Cases:

```kotlin
class ConfirmAttendanceUseCase(
    private val userRoleRepository: UserRoleRepository,
    private val athleteProfileRepository: AthleteProfileRepository,
    private val sessionRepository: TrainingSessionRepository,
    private val attendanceRepository: AttendanceRepository
) {
    suspend fun execute(userId: UUID, sessionId: UUID): Attendance {
        // 1. Validate user has ATHLETE role
        val roles = userRoleRepository.findByUserId(userId)
        if (!roles.any { it.role == Role.ATHLETE }) {
            throw UnauthorizedException("Only athletes can confirm attendance")
        }

        // 2. Validate session exists and is not cancelled
        val session = sessionRepository.findById(sessionId)
            ?: throw NotFoundException("Session not found")

        if (session.status == SessionStatus.CANCELLED) {
            throw BusinessRuleException("Cannot confirm for cancelled session")
        }

        // 3. Check capacity
        val confirmedCount = attendanceRepository.getConfirmedCount(sessionId)
        if (confirmedCount >= session.capacity) {
            throw CapacityExceededException("Session is at full capacity")
        }

        // 4. Create attendance record
        val attendance = Attendance(
            userId = userId,
            sessionId = sessionId,
            status = AttendanceStatus.CONFIRMED,
            confirmedAt = Timestamp.now()
        )

        // 5. Return result
        return attendanceRepository.save(attendance)
    }
}

class UnlockCalendarUseCase(
    private val userRoleRepository: UserRoleRepository,
    private val calendarAccessRepository: CalendarAccessRepository
